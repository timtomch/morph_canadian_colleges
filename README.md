This scraper extracts a list of public community colleges from the [Colleges and Institutes Canada](http://www.collegesinstitutes.ca/) [members directory](http://www.collegesinstitutes.ca/our-members/member-directory/).

It was developed by [Thomas Guignard](https://about.me/timtom) to demonstrate web scraping at a [Library Carpentry workshop](https://code4libtoronto.github.io/2016-07-28-librarycarpentry/) in Toronto on July 28-29, 2016.

Currently only the college name and homepage url are scraped.

This scraper runs on [Morph](hhttps://morph.io/timtomch/morph_canadian_colleges) and its source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/timtomch/morph_canadian_colleges).
